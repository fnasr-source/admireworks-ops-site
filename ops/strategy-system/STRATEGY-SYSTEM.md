# Admireworks Direct Response Strategy Presentation System

## Overview

This file instructs Claude Code (or any AI coding assistant) to automatically generate a complete Direct Response Marketing Strategy as a **web-based interactive presentation** for any Admireworks client. The output is a self-contained folder with an HTML/CSS/JS presentation that can be opened in a browser, presented to clients, and versioned with comments.

---

## HOW TO USE

### Step 1: Place This File
Copy this file (`STRATEGY-SYSTEM.md`) into your client project folder alongside:
- The client brief document (PDF, DOCX, or text)
- The kick-off meeting transcript (if available)
- Any existing brand assets from the client

### Step 2: Run Phase 1 — Strategy Content Generation (Claude Opus)
Open Claude Code in the project folder and paste:

```
@STRATEGY-SYSTEM.md Generate the full Direct Response Marketing Strategy for this client. Use the client brief and any transcripts in this folder. Follow Phase 1 instructions completely. Output all strategy content as structured JSON in /strategy/content.json and generate the full web presentation in /strategy/presentation/.
```

### Step 3: Run Phase 2 — Visual Asset Generation (Google Gemini via AI Studio)
After Phase 1 is complete, Claude Code will generate a prompt file at `/strategy/phase2-image-prompts.md`. Take this file to **Google AI Studio** (using Gemini 2.0 Flash or Gemini 2.5 Pro with Imagen 3) and run each prompt to generate the images. Save them into `/strategy/presentation/assets/generated/`.

Alternatively, if you have API access, Claude Code will output a script at `/strategy/generate-images.sh` that calls the Gemini API directly.

### Step 4: Present
Open `/strategy/presentation/index.html` in your browser. Use two browser tabs:
- **Tab 1**: Presenter view (append `?mode=presenter` to URL)
- **Tab 2**: Client view (append `?mode=client` to URL)

Both tabs sync via `BroadcastChannel` API — advancing slides in presenter view advances the client view automatically.

## PHASE 1: STRATEGY CONTENT GENERATION

### Role & Context

You are an **Admireworks Senior Direct Response Marketing Strategist**. You specialize in the StoryBrand framework, direct response marketing, and creating high-converting funnels for businesses across the MENA region and beyond.

Admireworks is a venture services agency based in Dubai, UAE. Their brand promise: "Admirable Venture Services every time." They focus on helping entrepreneurs and businesses start, grow, and scale through strategy, brand, communications, technology, and marketing.

### Core Methodology

Every strategy you create must be grounded in:

1. **Direct Response Marketing Principles**: Every piece of content, ad, and funnel element must drive a measurable action. No vanity metrics — only conversion-focused KPIs.

2. **StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller)**: Position the CLIENT'S CUSTOMER as the hero, the client's business as the guide. Structure messaging around:
   - **Character**: The customer and what they want
   - **Problem**: External, internal, and philosophical problems they face
   - **Guide**: The client's business (demonstrating empathy + authority)
   - **Plan**: Clear steps to engage
   - **Call to Action**: Direct and transitional CTAs
   - **Success**: What life looks like after
   - **Failure**: What happens if they don't act

3. **Admireworks Strategy Structure**: Follow the exact section order used across all Admireworks strategies (The Accounter, Zambalita Fit, QYD, Edrak):

### Content Generation Rules

1. **Tone**: Authoritative, practical, conversion-focused. No fluff. Every statement should lead to action.
2. **Language**: Match the client's market. If the client serves Arabic-speaking markets, ad copy and landing page content MUST be in Arabic. Strategy analysis can be in English.
3. **Data**: Use real, verifiable market data. Include statistics with approximate sources. If exact data is unavailable, use reasonable estimates clearly marked as estimates.
4. **StoryBrand Integration**: The messaging strategy section must explicitly use the StoryBrand framework elements (Character, Problem, Guide, Plan, CTA, Success, Failure).
5. **Funnel Design**: Always include retargeting loops. Never design a linear-only funnel.
6. **HVCO**: The High Value Content Offer must be genuinely valuable — not a thinly veiled sales pitch. It should solve a real micro-problem for the target audience.
7. **Bilingual Support**: For MENA clients, provide Arabic content with RTL formatting support. Use font "Noor" for Arabic text in the presentation.

### Output Format

Generate a file at `/strategy/content.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "client_name": "Client Name",
    "strategy_type": "Direct Response Marketing Strategy",
    "quarter": "Q4",
    "year": "2025",
    "language": "en",
    "rtl_support": true,
    "created_date": "2025-01-15",
    "version": "1.0",
    "versions": [
      {
        "version": "1.0",
        "date": "2025-01-15",
        "notes": "Initial strategy",
        "comments": []
      }
    ]
  },
  "slides": [
    {
      "id": "slide-001",
      "section": "cover",
      "layout": "cover",
      "content": {
        "title": "Direct Response Marketing Strategy",

        "branding": "@admireworks"
      },
      "presenter_notes": "Welcome everyone. Today we present the direct response marketing strategy for [Client Name]...",
      "comments": [],
      "image_needed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "slide-002",
      "section": "strategy_brief",
      "layout": "grid-6",
      "content": {
        "boxes": [
          {"number": "01", "title": "Situation & Objectives"},
          {"number": "02", "title": "Audience & Competitors"},
          {"number": "03", "title": "Campaign Strategy"},
          {"number": "04", "title": "Social Media Strategy"},
          {"number": "05", "title": "Measurement & Evaluation"},
          {"number": "06", "title": "Context-specific"}
        ]
      },
      "presenter_notes": "Here is our strategy overview...",
      "comments": [],
      "image_needed": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Each slide object must include:
- `id`: Unique slide identifier
- `section`: Which strategy section it belongs to
- `layout`: One of the predefined layouts (see Layout System below)
- `content`: Section-specific content object
- `presenter_notes`: What the presenter should say (visible only in presenter view)
- `comments`: Array of comment objects `{author, date, text, resolved}` — starts empty
- `image_needed`: Boolean — if true, also include `image_prompt` for Phase 2

---

## PHASE 2: VISUAL ASSET GENERATION

### Image Prompt File

After Phase 1, generate `/strategy/phase2-image-prompts.md` containing prompts optimized for **Google Imagen 3** (via Gemini 2.0 Flash or Gemini 2.5 Pro on AI Studio).

Format:

```markdown
# Phase 2: Image Generation Prompts
## Instructions
Run each prompt below in Google AI Studio using Gemini with Imagen 3.
Save each generated image with the filename specified.
Place all images in: /strategy/presentation/assets/generated/

---

### Image 1: [slide-id]
**Filename:** slide-003-bg.png
**Dimensions:** 1920x1080
**Prompt:**
[Detailed Imagen 3 prompt here - professional, brand-aligned imagery]

---

### Image 2: [slide-id]
**Filename:** slide-010-illustration.png
**Dimensions:** 800x600
**Prompt:**
[Detailed prompt]
```

### Image Prompt Guidelines for Imagen 3

1. **Style**: Professional, corporate, clean. Align with Admireworks brand — navy blue (#001a70) and gold (#cc9f53) as dominant colors.
2. **Types of images needed**:
   - Section divider backgrounds (abstract geometric patterns using brand colors)
   - Persona illustrations (professional character portraits)
   - Funnel diagrams (clean, modern flowcharts)
   - Data visualization backgrounds
   - Market/industry imagery
3. **Never generate**: Text in images (text is handled by HTML/CSS), logos (use the actual logo files), screenshots of real websites.
4. **Prompt format**: Always specify "professional corporate marketing presentation slide, clean modern design, navy blue (#001a70) and gold (#cc9f53) color palette" as base context.

### Presentation Engine Specification (index.html + app.js + styles.css)

#### Core Features

1. **Two-Tab Sync System**
   - `?mode=presenter` — Shows current slide + presenter notes + comments panel + slide navigator
   - `?mode=client` — Shows current slide only, clean view, no notes
   - Sync mechanism: `BroadcastChannel('aw-strategy-sync')`
   - Presenter tab sends `{type: 'navigate', slideIndex: N}` messages
   - Client tab receives and updates accordingly
   - Both tabs work in the same browser, separate windows

2. **Slide Navigation**
   - Arrow keys (left/right) to navigate
   - Slide number indicator (e.g., "12 / 45")
   - Clickable slide thumbnails in presenter view sidebar
   - Touch/swipe support for tablet presentations

3. **Comment System**
   - In presenter view: comment panel per slide
   - Add comments with author name and text
   - Comments are timestamped
   - Comments persist in localStorage and can be exported
   - "Export Comments" button downloads a JSON file with all comments organized by slide
   - Comments can be marked as resolved

4. **Version Management**
   - Version selector dropdown in presenter view
   - "Save as New Version" button — snapshots current content.json with all comments
   - Version history panel showing all versions with dates and notes
   - Compare versions (shows which slides changed)

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts (Presenter View)**
   - `→` or `Space` — Next slide
   - `←` — Previous slide
   - `F` — Toggle fullscreen
   - `C` — Toggle comment panel
   - `N` — Toggle presenter notes
   - `Esc` — Exit fullscreen
   - `Home` — First slide
   - `End` — Last slide

#### Layout System

The presentation engine must support these slide layouts:

## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE

When you receive the command to generate a strategy, follow this exact sequence:

### Step 1: Read & Analyze Input
1. Read all files in the current directory (client brief, transcripts, any existing materials)
2. Identify: client name, industry, target market, language requirements, existing assets

### Step 2: Generate Strategy Content
1. Create `/strategy/` directory
2. Work through each strategy section in order
3. For each section, generate:
   - Content following the exact Admireworks format
   - Presenter notes (what to say when presenting this slide)
   - Identify which slides need generated images
4. Save complete strategy as `/strategy/content.json`

### Step 3: Generate Presentation Engine
1. Create `/strategy/presentation/` directory structure
2. Generate `index.html` — single-page application that:
   - Loads content.json
   - Renders slides based on layout type
   - Implements presenter/client view modes
   - Implements BroadcastChannel sync
   - Implements comment system with localStorage persistence
   - Implements version management
3. Generate `styles.css` — complete brand-aligned stylesheet
4. Generate `app.js` — presentation engine logic
5. Copy font files and brand assets into the assets directory

### Step 4: Generate Phase 2 Prompts
1. For each slide where `image_needed: true`, create an Imagen 3 prompt
2. Save all prompts to `/strategy/phase2-image-prompts.md`
3. Optionally generate `generate-images.sh` for API-based generation

### Step 5: Verify & Report
1. Verify all files are created
2. Provide a summary of:
   - Total slides generated
   - Number of images needed for Phase 2
   - Instructions for opening the presentation
   - Any assumptions made that need client confirmation

## COMMENT EXPORT FORMAT

When exporting comments, use this format:

```json
{
  "export_date": "2025-01-20",
  "client": "Client Name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "total_comments": 15,
  "slides_with_comments": [
    {
      "slide_id": "slide-005",
      "slide_title": "Biggest Challenge",
      "comments": [
        {
          "author": "Ahmad",
          "date": "2025-01-16",
          "text": "Client wants to emphasize this more strongly",
          "resolved": false
        },
        {
          "author": "Sara",
          "date": "2025-01-16",
          "text": "Agreed — add supporting data from the brief",
          "resolved": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## VERSION MANAGEMENT

When creating a new version:
1. Snapshot current `content.json` (with all comments) to `/strategy/presentation/versions/v{X.Y}/content.json`
2. Increment version in `content.json` meta
3. Add version entry to the versions array with date and notes
4. Clear resolved comments from the active version (keep unresolved)
5. The presentation engine shows a version dropdown to compare

## QUICK REFERENCE: ADMIREWORKS STRATEGY DNA

Every Admireworks strategy follows this DNA:

1. **Start with empathy** — Show you understand the client's world before prescribing solutions
2. **Data before opinion** — Environmental scanning and competitor analysis provide the evidence base
3. **Gaps reveal opportunities** — Market gaps directly map to market opportunities
4. **Persona-driven** — Everything flows from deeply understood personas
5. **Funnel thinking** — Every strategy culminates in a clear conversion funnel
6. **Direct response** — Every touchpoint must drive a measurable action
7. **Retargeting is non-negotiable** — Always plan for the "no" path
8. **HVCO is the bridge** — The High Value Content Offer connects awareness to conversion
9. **Bilingual where needed** — MENA clients need Arabic content, not just English
10. **Measurement closes the loop** — Clear KPIs and tracking from day one
